          <h2>Work Experience</h2>
          <p> For my entire time of being in the United states, I have had 3 jobs. Two out of the three have been with Harris Teeter and the other was at Jiffy Lube which I won't include below because 
            I was involved with them for less than a week. I was a Highschool student at the time during my first stint with the company. I quit then cane back a few months later to become a produce associate.
